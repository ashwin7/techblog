TESTING





## Getting The Most Out Of Posts

Scattered throughout posts are different alert boxes.  The green ones have
tips that you may find useful like this:

::: tip
Ashwin was here.
:::

Blue boxes with the info icon are to display pieces of information that may or
may not apply to you... for example:

::: info
This is some `info`
:::

Red alert boxes have information you should **definitely** read because it could
be very important or dangerous.

::: warning
THIS IS WARNING
:::

**Errors & Mistakes** 

Site may contain errors. Consider it in beta.


## How This Blog Was Built

With :heart: and :coffee:. 

It uses [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) to generate the static site.  

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is what I use to deploy the site.
